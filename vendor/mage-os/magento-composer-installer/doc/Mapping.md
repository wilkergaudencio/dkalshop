Mapping
=======

### Mapping in general

There are several ways how the mapping from files in the package into the Magento source is accomplished:

1. A mapping in the composer.json
2. MagentoConnect package.xml file
3. [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) file

As long as one of these mappings can be found, Magento modules are installable.

The package files are symlinked into the Magento instance by default. You can also use a copy or hardlink deploy strategy
by configuring it in the root composer.json (see below).

A repository of composer ready Magento modules can be found on http://packages.firegento.com/

The Magento root directory must be specified in the ```composer.json``` under ```extra.magento-root-dir```.

**NOTE:** modman's include and bash feature will never get supported!



### Mapping per JSON
If you don't like modman files, you can define mappings in a package composer.json file instead.

```json
{
   "name": "test/test",
   "type": "magento-module",
    "extra": {
        "map": [
            ["themes/default/skin", "public/skin/frontend/foo/default"],
            ["themes/default/design", "public/app/design/frontend/foo/default"],
            ["modules/My_Module/My_Module.xml", "public/app/etc/modules/My_Module.xml"],
            ["modules/My_Module/code", "public/app/code/local/My/Module"],
            ["modules/My_Module/frontend/layout/mymodule.xml", "public/app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/mymodule.xml"]
        ]
    }
}
```
